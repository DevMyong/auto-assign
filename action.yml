  Automatically assigns default metadata to pull requests. This action:
    - Adds labels based on PR title keywords (e.g., "feat" becomes "enhancement", "fix" becomes "bug", etc.)
    - Adds d-day labels based on code size.
    - Sets the PR author as the default assignee.
    - Requests reviewers from all repository contributors (randomly selecting up to 10 if there are more than 10).
